# Janus Configuration

A base rackfile and directory structure to keep [Janus distrobution's](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) in
sync between installations. Also includes all the plugins that I use in
my VIM (in addition to what Janus provides) 

## Installation

To get the initial set of vimrc files linked simply run `rake install`.
The rakefile will move existing vimrc files to <file>.old

## Updating

Updating is as simple as running `rake update` this will take care
